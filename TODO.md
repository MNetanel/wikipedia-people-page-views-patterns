- Explain optimization steps taken.
- Divide into small tables by predefined groups, for example: singers (occupation/instrument), people from the 1900s (dob). IN EACH GROUP find patterns. -- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74432537/cast-a-list-column-into-dummy-columns-in-python-polars
- Questions:
  - what pattern is common for each group?\
  - Who are the outliers that don't conform to this pattern?
  - (more?)
- Method:
  - kmeans clustering (tslearn - fast! or simply sklearn with set_output='polars')
  - ?
- Ideas:
  - smoothing before kmeans
  - kmeans on ts *features* (functime or polars-ds for feat. extr.)
