# Ideas
1. Can we predict a country's view on a subject by analyzing wikipedia *attention* and *coverage* pattern?
	1. For example, Israel:
		1. [International recognition of Israel - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_Israel)
		2. [International Opinion Toward Israel](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/international-opinion-toward-israel)
		3. [Transatlantic Trends Survey Series](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/series/235/publications)
2.  Or: Can the amount of *attention* and *coverage* a country gives to Israel predict the attitude towards it?
	1. For example, @ruprechterPoorAttentionWealth2023 : *"We find that major Wikipedia language editions have a skewed focus, with more attention given to events in the worldâ€™s more economically developed countries and less attention to events in less affluent regions. However, other factors, such as the number of deaths in a disaster, are also associated with the attention an event receives."*
3. Or: can it predict the sentiment in the article?
4. What is *attention*?
	1. *Attention* = Page views
	2. Page views of related pages (could be positive or negative attention)
	3. *Coverage* = Number of edits
